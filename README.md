# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This is a simple game where you have to guess a number within a range, based on feedback from the system about whether your guess is too high or too low. 

## How to Play
1. Start the game, and select the difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: 10 chances to guess.
   - **Medium**: 5 chances to guess.
   - **Hard**: 3 chances to guess.
2. The system will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guesses one at a time.
4. The system will provide hints after each guess until you:
   - Guess the number correctly.
   - Run out of attempts.
5. Your score is calculated based on the number of attempts used and the difficulty level.
